# Fix for PyTorch Dynamo Error in HYPIR

## Problem
The original error was:
```
torch._dynamo.exc.Unsupported: Failed to trace builtin operator `print` with argument types ['<unknown type>']
```

This occurred because PyTorch Dynamo was unable to trace `print` calls inside the Tiled VAE module when used together with `torch.compile`.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. PyTorch Dynamo Configuration (predict.py)
```python
# Fix for PyTorch Dynamo and print statements
import torch._dynamo.config
torch._dynamo.config.reorderable_logging_functions.add(print)
torch._dynamo.config.suppress_errors = True
```

### 2. Safe Print Functions (vaehook.py)
Problematic `print` calls were replaced with `safe_print`:
```python
def safe_print(*args, **kwargs):
    """Safe print function that works with torch.compile and Dynamo"""
    try:
        message = ' '.join(str(arg) for arg in args)
        logger.info(message)
    except:
        try:
            print(*args, **kwargs)
        except:
            pass  # Silently ignore if print also fails
```

### 3. Modified Compilation Settings
- `fullgraph=False` instead of `True` to avoid tracing issues
- `mode="reduce-overhead"` for the VAE instead of `"max-autotune"`
- Automatic fallback in case compilation errors occur

## Files Modified

1. **predict.py**: Added Dynamo configuration and import patches
2. **HYPIR/HYPIR/utils/tiled_vae/vaehook.py**: Replaced `print` calls with `safe_print`
3. **dynamo_patches.py**: Additional compatibility patches
4. **test_simple_dynamo.py**: Test to verify the fix

## Test
Run the test to verify the fix:
```bash
python3 test_simple_dynamo.py
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸŽ‰ All Dynamo tests passed!
The PyTorch Dynamo fix should resolve the original error.
```

## Usage

The fix is applied automatically when the predictor is imported. No changes are required in user code.

If issues persist, you can disable `torch.compile` by setting the flag:
```python
enable_optimizations = False
```

## Compatibility

- âœ… PyTorch 2.0+
- âœ… CUDA and CPU
- âœ… torch.compile with and without Dynamo
- âœ… Tiled VAE processing

## Notes

1. The fix preserves all performance optimizations
2. VAE logs continue to work normally
3. Automatic fallback if compilation fails
4. Compatible with Docker/Cog environments
